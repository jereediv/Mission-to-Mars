# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Robin, our client is putting together a web scraping app in hopes of impressing NASA to get a job there. Her goal is to have her web app scrape information, images and their titles to display real time info as it gets updated on the scraping site. We also want to make sure the app displays correctly and neatly on all types of devices.

## Summary
Using Jupyter notebook and Chrome to scrape from the site, we were able to get image urls as well as titles and data to display on her web app. VS Code was used to integrate these urls into our source code. Then Mongo stores the scrapings into a database to be used by the app. We also used the Bootstrap CDN to ensure she ends up with a responsive page.
